# Spongebob Tamagotchi
#### https://johnzerbe.github.io/tomagotchi-project/
My official first project. I've created a browser-based tamagotchi game using JavaScript. Keep Spongebob alive by feeding him, giving him rest, and playing with him. Last long enough and he'll evolve into different appearances.

# Motivation
As stated above, this is my first official project using JavaScript. After learning some of the fundamentals and concepts of this language, I wanted to put together a simple, yet functional game. I loved watching Spongebob Squarepants as a kid (still do actually), so I thought a simple game such as this needed a light and fun theme.
